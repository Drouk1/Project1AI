# Bridge Crossing Optimization Using A* Algorithm

## Description
This project simulates and finds the optimal solution for the classic bridge-crossing problem using the A* search algorithm. Given a list of people with their respective crossing times, the goal is to find the quickest way to get everyone across a bridge at night using a single flashlight with at most two people crossing at once.
