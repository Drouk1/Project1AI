# Bridge-Crossing Problem Solver

This project presents an implementation of the A* algorithm to solve the classic bridge-crossing problem. A group of people must cross a bridge at night with only one flashlight. The bridge can only support two people at a time, and when two cross together, they move at the speed of the slower person. The aim is to find the quickest sequence to get all members across.

## Extended Description

### The Bridge-Crossing Problem

The bridge-crossing problem is a classic puzzle where a group needs to traverse a bridge at night. Possessing only a single flashlight, the bridge's perilous nature mandates its usage. The puzzle's complexity is heightened due to the bridge's limitation to support only two persons at once, requiring any pair to progress at the slower individual's pace.

### Objective

Our primary ambition with this project is to identify the swiftest method to usher all participants across the bridge without breaching any stipulations. This optimization problem is aptly tackled using the A* search algorithm. This pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm guarantees a solution (if one is feasible) and ensures its optimality.

### Implementation Details

1. **State Representation**: Every state in our system encapsulates:
   - Individuals on the bridge's left and right sides.
   - The flashlight's current location.
   - The total time expended till that point.

2. **Heuristic**: The heuristic applied offers an approximation of the time required to transition all members on the right to the left. By considering the maximum time among those yet to cross, the heuristic remains both admissible (never overestimating the cost) and consistent, endorsing A*'s optimal application to this problem.

3. **Search**: Utilizing A*, the search iteratively evaluates states. Each state denotes a configuration of people on the bridge's two sides and the flashlight's position. A state's evaluation priority is deduced from its heuristic value combined with the genuine cost to attain that state.

4. **Optimal Solution**: The conclusive solution is a sequence of states (or moves) leading to the quickest time ensuring all individuals' safe bridge crossing.

### Challenges

An unsophisticated method might endeavor to brute-force every potential crossing combination to identify the fastest sequence. However, the exponential growth in possible combinations with the addition of family members necessitates a more nuanced algorithm, like A*. Through A*'s intelligent navigation of the solution space, unnecessary explorations are minimized, and solution optimality is assured.
